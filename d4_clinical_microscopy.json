      "question": "What is the maximum recommended time between urine collection and analysis to preserve specimen integrity?",
      "options": ["Within 30 minutes", "Within 1 hour", "Within 2 hours", "Within 4 hours"],
      "answer": "Within 2 hours",
      "explanation": "Urine should be analyzed within 2 hours of collection to prevent bacterial proliferation and cellular degradation."

      "question": "Which urinary cast is most strongly associated with nephrotic syndrome?",
      "options": ["Hyaline cast", "Waxy cast", "Fatty cast", "Granular cast"],
      "answer": "Fatty cast",
      "explanation": "Fatty casts and oval fat bodies are classical findings in nephrotic syndrome due to lipiduria."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which microscopic urine analysis finding indicates glomerular bleeding?",
      "options": ["Red blood cell cast", "White blood cell cast", "Bacterial clumps", "Mucus threads"],
      "answer": "Red blood cell cast",
      "explanation": "RBC casts originate from the renal tubules and are indicative of glomerular origin bleeding."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which stain is used to detect fecal fat in stool samples?",
      "options": ["Gram stain", "Sudan III stain", "Periodic acid–Schiff stain", "Trichrome stain"],
      "answer": "Sudan III stain",
      "explanation": "Sudan III is used to visualize neutral lipids (triglycerides and fatty acids) in feces."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What cell type predominates in cerebrospinal fluid during viral meningitis?",
      "options": ["Neutrophils", "Lymphocytes", "Monocytes", "Eosinophils"],
      "answer": "Lymphocytes",
      "explanation": "Lymphocytic pleocytosis is characteristic of viral (aseptic) meningitis."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which body fluid appears milky due to high triglyceride content?",
      "options": ["Transudate", "Exudate", "Chylous effusion", "Hemorrhagic fluid"],
      "answer": "Chylous effusion",
      "explanation": "Chylous effusions contain milky lymph fluid rich in triglycerides due to lymphatic leakage."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is considered normal progressive sperm motility percentage in a semen analysis?",
      "options": ["≥30%", "≥40%", "≥50%", "≥60%"],
      "answer": "≥50%",
      "explanation": "According to WHO guidelines, normal progressive motility is 50% or higher."

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What effect does light exposure have on measured urine bilirubin?",
      "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "No effect", "Converts to urobilinogen"],
      "answer": "Decreases",
      "explanation": "Urine bilirubin is light-sensitive and will degrade, causing falsely low readings."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which parasitic egg is commonly found in midday urine specimens in endemic areas?",
      "options": ["Taenia solium", "Schistosoma haematobium", "Enterobius vermicularis", "Giardia lamblia"],
      "answer": "Schistosoma haematobium",
      "explanation": "S. haematobium eggs are best detected in urine collected around midday when egg excretion peaks."
    },
